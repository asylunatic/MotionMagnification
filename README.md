# Motion magnification project by Vera Hoveling and Niels Hoogerwerf

In this repository you can find the implementations that we made for the final project on video magnification, for the course Advanced Image Processing (AP3132). To run the code, please run make.m first. Also, please note that our phase-based implementation is named 'feestbeest' (inside joke for the Dutch).

Our report on the project is included here as well as FinalReport.pdf.
